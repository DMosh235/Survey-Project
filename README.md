# Survey-Project
This project aims to display some of the skills I have built. This project was built on my own using the knowledge I gained during my previous practice challenges.

Some of the HTML/CSS skills applied during this project include:

  1. Text boxes
  2. Radio inputs
  3. Check Boxes
  4. Email formatting requirements
  5. Hyperlink implementation
  6. Image scaling
  7. Adjustable formatting
  
 The overall goal of this format was to gain comfort building a product based on a set of requirements as well as expanding upon those requirements using CSS to improve functionality and accessability.
